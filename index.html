                <h2>First Car - 1994 Saturn SL1 - "The Saturn"</h2>
                <p>The first car I "owned" was a '94 Saturn SL1.  
                   My parents bought the Saturn in 1993, when I was just 2 years old.
                   They purchased it brand new out of a Saturn dealership, literally; it was showroom car, one of the select vehicles Saturn had inside their dealership to show off their flagship machines.
                   It wasn't 'love at first sight' or anything, but the Saturn met every requirement my parents had at the time (save for a cruise control, which they requested to be installed).<br>
                   <br>This car remained a constant in my life for over 24 years.
                   Resilient, fantastic gas mileage, fun to drive, easy to fix, I have dozens upon dozens of memories with this car.
                   As I grew older, one of my favorite series of memories are the weekend mornings spent with my father fixing the various problems which cropped up with an aging car.
                   From replacing the mechanism inside the door for the manual window openers, to replacing the brake pads and rotor, to the lower control arm for the suspension and the radiator when it failed.
                   It was our DIY vehicle, and it showed no signs of dying, as did most of the old Saturns.<br>
                   <br>The Saturn was the car used to teach me how to drive.
                   It also had a manual transmission, so I had to learn stick as well, which, sadly, seems to be a fading skill set.
                   When I finally got my driver's license it became "my car" for the duration of my time in high school.
                   So, I must confess, I didn't "own" the Saturn; it was still my parents' vehicle, I was just allowed to use it.<br>
                   <br>There's a quote from "Fight Club" which has stuck with me over the years: "The things you own, end up owning you."<br>
                   <br>Well, I was the first to admit the Saturn <i>owned</i> me.
                   I loved that car with all my heart.  I didn't want to let it go.
                   As I mentioned, it was one of the few constants in my life.
                   All the way back to my earliest memory, the Saturn was there.
                   So, in 2017, long after I had purchased my actual first car (below),
                    my father came to the realization when the cost of keeping the Saturn up to Virginia's vehicle inspection code
                    was more than the value of the 24 year old vehicle, it was time to donate it (no one would actually buy the thing).
                   My parents rarely drove it at that point. My mother had a newer vehicle she drove to work, and my father typically used public transportation.
                   There was a period of time where the Saturn sat parked on the street without being driven for nearly four months.
                   I didn't want to see it go. Neither of us did.
                   But, in the end, we agreed with the logic behind parting ways with the car.<br>
                   <br>The Saturn was just a car, after all.<br>
                   <br>But it was my <b><i>first</i></b> car.<br>
                   <br>It was picked up by a towing company in early December of 2017, carried off to be donated.<br>
                   <br>It hurt to see it go.<br>
                   <br>But the memories I made with that SL1 will always remain.<br>

                <h2>Second Car - 2001 Saturn SC1 - "Scone"</h2>
                <p>It's the summer of 2010. I had just finished my first year of college, and I was staying with my parents for the summer break.
                    I had finally saved enough money to buy my first car, and I wanted to get one before the start of the upcoming fall semester.
                    So, along with my father, we drove around (in the Saturn) to various private dealerships to find me a used car.
                    I obviously was dead set on getting another Saturn of some kind, and it had to be a stick shift.<br>
                    <br>Driving's boring otherwise.<br>
                    <br>After looking and test driving roughly six vehicles, I stumbled across a listing for a 2001 Saturn SC1 which had just about everything I wanted.
                    Color, silver. Transmission, the fun kind. Mileage, kinda high at 186,000 miles. No sun roof. 
                    Manual windows. Price, reasonable. No cruise control?! Managed to haggle the price down.
                    The auto loan was finalized, and I drove away with my first car: a 2001 Saturn SC1, which I promptly named "Scone".<br>
                    <br>I have a myriad of memories with this vehicle, as I had it through all my remaining years in college, but I won't go into great detail on those.
                    Just know the Scone was very similar to the Saturn mechanically, and such, it too became a fix it yourself vehicle.
                    Its radiator even failed in the exact same way the Saturn's did years beforehand.
                    At the start of of June in 2013, I drove to visit my parents who had moved to Virginia in 2012.
                    The Scone didn't have cruise control; the 12 hour drive there and back was... memorable.
                    As was the same drive when I accepted an offer from my parents to move in with them after graduating in 2014.<br>
                    <br>The three and a half years I was in Virginia... weren't the best.
                    I struggled to get my career going, working a simple part time job as the front desk clerk of the same condominium we lived in while trying to secure that career launching job.
                    In early 2018, with my struggles causing the three of us untold amounts of stress, I made the decision to move out,
                    moving to Washington state to pursue a GIS opportunity (spoilers: that failed to pan out as well).
                    In addition, the Scone had crossed over 222,000 miles by this point, and its wear and tear was starting to show.
                    The steering was no longer centered, it was leaking coolant, its previously stellar 35+ MPG plummeted to below 20, and it was failing emissions.
                    The final nail in the coffin was a terrifying grinding sound from the front axle when going 50 MPH or faster.
                    Without a private garage (note we were living in a condo), there was no way I could get the car fixed without spending two to three times the value of the car at a mechanic's shop.<br>
                    <br>So, the day before I flew out to Washington, I woke up before dawn as the towing company called saying they were early.
                    I went outside to find the kind man waiting with his truck near the Scone, and he asked for me to move the car into a spot it could be pulled onto the truck.
                    The Scone was parallel parked on the street in between two other vehicles, so it couldn't be safely extracted unless I moved it.
                    So, I sat back down in the driver's seat one last time, started up the sluggish, cold engine, and looked at the odometer:<br>
                    <br>222,216 miles.<br>
                    <br>...so close.<br>
                    <br>Following in the Saturn's footsteps just two months prior, I watched as the Scone was loaded onto a tow truck, heading to the same place we sent the Saturn to.
                    It was easier to let the Scone go, somehow. I had only owned it for 7 years, while the Saturn was in our family for 24.
                    The Scone was running into issue after issue with emission and mechanical failures, while the Saturn endured.<br>
                    <br>
                    I miss both vehicles.<br>
                    <br>
                    But as time passed, I've discovered the main, tangible reason why: both had manual transmissions.

                <h2>Current Car - 2008 Nissan Versa - "Versa"</h2>
                <p>On the first day of March in 2018, I moved from my parent's place in Virginia to Olympia, Washington.
                    I flew to the west coast with a backpack (full of stuff) and a box (full of heavier stuff), and moved in with a friend I have known for 15 years.
                    One of the most frustrating things about this move was the lack of a <i>car</i>.
                    There was no way the Scone would have made the trip to Washington (which was one of the reasons that led to the decision to donate it), so I arrived in Olympia without a vehicle of my own.
                    It was a notion I've never had to contend with; I always had access to the Saturn, and in time, the Scone.
                    Thankfully, Olympia had a surprisingly good public transport system, and I borrowed my roommate's bicycle to get to where I needed to go, but my range was limited.
                    Buses could only take me so far, using them added far too much time to the commute, and I wasn't exactly fit enough to ride a bike 10 miles everyday.<br>
                    <br>Fast forward five months to August of '18, and in a random phone call with my parents, I was lamenting on lack of said vehicle, when my father said:<br>
                    <br>"Well, since we bought the [Honda] Fit, we haven't used the [Nissan] Versa since May. It costs double the value of the car to fix all the scratches on the side, so I haven't sold it yet. Want it?"<br>
                    <br>"Of course I'd like to have it, but how would we get it over here?"<br>
                    <br>"We? There'd be no we; you'd fly back over here for a couple days, help us with a couple things, and then do what you do with a small hatchback: take it on a roadtrip."<br>
                    <br>"Wait wha-"<br>
                    <br>"I'll buy your plane ticket."<br>
                    <br>Normally, taking two or so weeks off work is not plausible.  However, I was between jobs at the time. 
                    While unemployment is stressful, it came with the benefit of not having a time limit for this roadtrip. 
                    I would be able to take my sweet, <i>sweet</i> time driving across the United States.<br>
                    <br>"Yeah, ok."<br>
                    <br>And so, four days after that conversation, I flew back to my parent's place in Virginia to acquire the Versa my parents were holding onto.  The roadtrip which followed was one of the best two weeks of my life.  I had never driven cross country before, and I reveled in... well, most of it.
                    Nebraksa with its never ending corn was draining, and Wyoming with its never ending... nothing was terrifiying.  The Versa's gas tank was 3/4 full when I stopped for gas after seeing a sign which read "Next service: 120 miles".  No way in heck I was going to chance it.
                    Once I arrived back home in Olympia, after several extended family members visited, four Witcher books listend to, sights seen, 3700+ miles driven, wildfire haze ruining the last 10 hours of the drive, I finally had a reliable mode of transportation, and my range was increased dramatically.<br>
                    <br>There's just one thing I'm wary about this car, and two things I dislike.<br>
                    <br>The transmission had to be replaced in 2016; it was a known issue by Nissan, who had an extended warrenty for their early CVT transmissions. That warrenty is now expired, and it's only a matter of time before it goes again.<br>
                    <br>The two things I dislike? It has so little power and an automatic transmission; there is no 'get up and go' with this car.  Frankly, after two years of owning the Versa, I'm looking foward to my next car.<br>
                    <br>It's a shame the Saturn brand was discontinued in 2010.

                </header>
                <section>
                    This page was initially going to go into more detail about the roadtrip, but it entailed far too much work for the scope of this assignment.<br>
                    <br>The trip itself took 13 days, driving through Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, (nearly every corner of) Illinois,
                    Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Oregon and finally, Washington state.
                    I visited tons of family and friends, saw many awesome sights, and listened to the majority of one of my favorite fantasty series along the way.
                    It was a fantastic two weeks, and I wish to share a few images from the trip.  I hope the opportunity arises once more for me to hit the road again.<br>
                    <br>Oh wait, the best part?  The Versa's transmission didn't fail while I was in the middle of the Rocky Mountains.

                                    And finally, my favorite part of the trip, the Columbia River Gorge in northern Oregon, unfortunately blanketed in haze.<br>
                                    That red dot is indeed the Sun.  It disappeared from view (well above the horizon) maybe five minutes after this picture was taken.
